## Installation
Download the develop folder and open the console at the develop level. Once here, run "npm i" to download all required dependencies. Then run "npm run build" to build the static folders.

## Usage
Once the build is complete, the application can be ran. Run "npm run start:dev" to run the application in development mode and run locally. Once the application starts an account can be made on the sign up page, and the account will be saved locally and can be re-logged into once logged out. Search for books and click that "add" button to save them. Navigate to your saved books in the navbar and choose books to remove. 

## Contribution
Feel free to pull from and use this code for your own authentication and MERN applications. If you had any advice or tips utilizing authentication and MERN feel free to send me an email!

## Test
 Refer to usage instructions but in addition open the GQL url that will have been provided in the console upon starting the application. Tests can be ran within the apollo interface to check on queries and mutations to ensure that books are being saved, can be removed, and users are being added.
